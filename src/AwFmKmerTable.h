 * Function:  awFmNucleotideKmerSeedRangeFromTable
 * --------------------
 * Given an ascii nucleotide kmer, queries the kmerSeedTable for the partially completed range in the backward suffix
 * array, and returns a copy of that range. This function looks up the range for the suffix of length equal to the kmers
 * stored in the seed table. As such, using this to query for kmers that are shorter than those in the table is
 * undefined behavior.
 *
 *  Inputs:
 *    index: AwFmIndex struct to search
 *    kmer: ascii nucleotide character string to search for in the kmerSeedTable.
 *    kmerLength: length, in characters of the kmer. This value is used to determine
 *      where the suffix occurrs in the kmer string.
 *
 *  Returns:
 *    Copy of the AwFmSearchRange containing the startPtr and endPtr for the kmer seed.

 * --------------------

 * 	suffix characters that would be used to query the table.
 *  Inputs:

 * 		kmer: pointer to the start of the kmer
 * 		kmerLength: length of the kmer in question.
 *
 *  Returns:
 *    true if the kmer is eligible for using the kmer seed table, or false otherwise.
